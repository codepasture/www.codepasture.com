# HayTracker App Store Requirements

## Required Pages

### 1. Support Page
A page where users can get help, report bugs, or ask questions.

**Options:**
- Simple contact form
- Link to GitHub issues
- FAQ section
- Email contact

**URL needed for:** App Store Connect "Support URL" field

### 2. Privacy Policy Page
Required by Apple. Since HayTracker stores all data locally and doesn't collect user information, this can be straightforward.

**Should cover:**
- No data collection
- All data stored locally on device
- No analytics or tracking
- No third-party data sharing

**URL needed for:** App Store Connect "Privacy Policy URL" field

## Consideration: HayTracker Product Page

The site should probably have a dedicated page for HayTracker that includes:
- App description and screenshots
- Link to App Store
- Features overview
- Support and privacy policy links

This would give the app a proper home on codepasture.com and provide a central place to link the support and privacy URLs.
